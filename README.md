#Reezy

This is a cheap clone of Keezy. I figured I'd learned enough iOS basics to
throw together something with similar functionality, using a collection
view, gesture recognizers, audio recording & playback. Clone it & run it
to see what's up.

I'm still a beginner at this stuff so any advice is appreciated.

Things I'm not confident about:
* Holding audio recorders/players in memory vs. instantiating them when
  needed & discarding them immediately after
* Should probably make more files/classes to handle different sets of
  methods (the main view controller is pretty fat)
